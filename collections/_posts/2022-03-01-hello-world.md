I'd like to keep it simple,
I am a passionate computer science student, with a particular interest in systems and network security.

I like the CTFs that I often play with my team, [dcode-us][ctf-team-link].

Every now and then I work as a freelance (I do the maintenance of some sites around on the internet) but I prefer to keep myself free from big commitments to continue my studies and be able to deepen in parallel the topics that fascinate me.

At the time of writing this post I am mainly focusing on binary exploitation and low level programming.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this blog, the idea is to keep it as a diary to publish my research, write-ups or just to post about what I find interesting. Also this is a spare time project, so it may happen that I don't publish new content for a while.

Last disclaimer I would like to make is that my native language is not English, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes I will surely make in writing the posts.
